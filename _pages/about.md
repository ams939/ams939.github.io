Hello and welcome! I'm Aleksanteri Sladek and this is my (very much in progress) personal website and blog, focused on my career and interests as a doctoral student in Probabilistic Machine Learning at Aalto University. Hence, the content here will be mainly focused on machine learning, probability theory and information theory. As the name suggests, the topics discussed are chosen largely by chance; Specifically by the stochastic process that is my motivation to write informative content about the things I study. Stay tuned for more.
