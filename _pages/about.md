## The Informative Prior

Hello and welcome! I'm Aleksanteri Sladek and this is my (very much in progress) personal website and blog, which focuses on my career and interests as a researcher in the field of Probabilistic Machine Learning at Aalto University. Hence, the content here will be mainly focused on machine learning, probability theory and information theory. So come along and observe the noisy process that is my motivation to write informative content about the things I learn about and study. Stay tuned for more!
